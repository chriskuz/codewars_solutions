    "This was hard. First attempt was made with datetime and time modules built-in python. I believe these could've been used to solve the problem with some cleanup eliminating the years and days, but it was recognized that the problem could be solved without such modules. Another approach was to answer the problem directly by converting the stringsz into integers and separating the hours and minutes apart. The largest time difference between hours would be recognized. The next step would've been to point to the times where the time difference came from, and associate the hours and minutes together and their respective differences. Ultimately, this method was not pursued as it became inefficient. The final method, crediting Github user [AlxSp](https://github.com/AlxSp), for the oversight implemented a more memory efficient method to solve the problem where only one list was generated with list comprehension and one for loop was used. [Divmod documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod) was really helpful in quickly handling any needed conversions towards the end with "
