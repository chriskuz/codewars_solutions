# Future Work
I will be considering adding more SQL problems, higher Kata based problems, as well as solve problems in other languages. I will even plan on linking problems together to other languages, should I choose to work on the same problems. 

# Author Background
I am a Data Scientist who primarily works in Python, but am looking to expand upon my education further into other lower level languages and comprehend computer science theory. I have graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and have achieved an E.I.T. certification, verified in the state of New York. Programming started as a hobby to me, until it was adapted into my engineering career through MATLAB. Working with MATLAB for 3 years and analyzing lab data on a weekly basis was enough convincing for to make a leap into Python and data science. I studied Data Science through General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program and have been working independently since then. I thoroughly enjoy mathematics, physics, and other sciences. I hope to individually make an impact or be part of a team focused on driving innovating change into society.
